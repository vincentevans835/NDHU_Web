                        <p class="card-text">National Dong Hwa University was founded in July 1994 with the planning stage
                            started three years earlier.
    
                            In October 1991, the National Dong Hwa University Planning Office was established in Shoufeng,
                            Hualien, by the Ministry of Education as part of its mission to foster the balanced regional
                            development of Taiwan through the even distribution of higher education systems in the north,
                            south, east and west of the island. Professor Paul Tzung - Tsan Mu was appointed to head the
                            Office and led the development of plans for eastern Taiwan's first comprehensive university.
    
                            On July 1, 1994, National Dong Hwa University was formally inaugurated with Professor Mu serving
                            as its founding President. After seven years of vigorous and unflagging commitment, Professor Mu
                            resigned his administrative duties at the University in the summer of 2001. By then, National
                            Dong Hwa University was established with four colleges, namely the College of Humanities and
                            Social Sciences, the College of Sciences and Engineering, the College of Management, and the
                            College of Indigenous Studies.
    
    
    
                            The College of Indigenous Studies was founded in August 2001. Being the first aboriginal school
                            on ethnic studies in Taiwan, the College of Indigenous Studies was established with the mission
                            of universalizing and internationalizing ethnicity issues, and serving as an epicenter for
                            Taiwanese ethnic and Austronesian research</p>
                        <p>
                            On January 23, 2002, Professor Wen - Shu Hwang, who shared Professor Mu's mission of
                            transforming a series of humble sugarcane fields into a distinguished university since the very
                            beginning, was elected to serve as Professor Mu's successor. Under Professor Hwang's innovative
                            leadership, the University continued to strive for excellent teaching, research and community
                            outreach.
    
                            In 2004, the College of Marine Science was established in Pingtung as the fifth college of
                            National Dong Hwa University. The establishment of the College was a pioneering act in Taiwan by
                            combining the resources and expertise of a university and a prestigious museum, the National
                            Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium.
