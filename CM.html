                        <p class="card-text">Established on August 1st 1995 following the trend of international integration
                            and division of labor, the College of Management aims to cultivate management professionals
                            equipped with innovative thinking, global visions, and specialized knowledge as well as skills.
                            The development perspective is to establish a high-quality management college equipped with
                            specialized characteristics and emphasizing the purpose of application whereas the education
                            objective is to cultivate management and academic professionals both with a global vision and
                            capable of integrating different knowledge and analyzing decisions.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">There are in 2011-2012 six departments, Business Administration, International
                            Business, Accounting, Information Management, Finance, and Tourism, Recreation, and Leisure
                            Studies featuring a variety of degree programs including Ph.D., Master, In-Service Master,
                            International Master, Bachelor, and International Bachelor with 71 faculty members and 1,882
                            students in total. Facing the rapid development of globalization, in order to differentiate
                            itself from those with the original credit system, the College has been working on incorporating
                            teaching resources from all departments into creating a more flexible, forward-looking, and
                            integrated program system. In light of that, each and every college- and dept.-level program is
                            complete as well as independent, and beneficial to systemize teaching and professionalize
                            learning. The program-based system is able to not only integrate teaching resources to make
                            courses more specialized, but also give students an opportunity to choose the second
                            professional program. With help from diversified courses, students can incorporate, even refine,
                            more easily knowledge of their second specialty or sub-specialty into their major to reinforce
                            their competitiveness when seeking employment.</p>
